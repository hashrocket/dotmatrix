# hr

A collection of useful scripts, based loosely on 37signals' sub

## Installation

If you don't already have a hashrocket directory, create one and CD into it.

This will set up the hr command and completions:

    git clone git://github.com/hashrocket/hr
    cd hr
    ./bin/hr init
    # follow instructions, adding the line to either .bashrc.local or .zshrc.local

## Usage

Open a new shell and run `hr`. Each subcommand is self-documenting.
