" Primary function
" gS - split a one liner into multiple lines
" gJ - do the opposite
Plug 'AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim'

" Used with pivotal stories for a bulk import
 Plug 'adamlowe/vim-slurper'

" Support tab completion
" TODO: is there a better tab completion plugin?
Plug 'ervandew/supertab'

" Allows you to easily line things up like so:
" a = 1
" back = 3
"
" Becomes
" a    = 1
" back = 3
"
" Which is a pattern that disgusts me. So I will be removing this to an
" 'optional' load file that you can un-comment in case you're working with
" people who prefer their code to look awful.
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'

" Buffer deletion in vim.
" This could be useful if you have a long running instance of vim and you were
" looking to start work on eg a different branch. However, I don't know that I
" would ever remeber to use it...
" Tentative removal
Plug 'jbranchaud/vim-bdubs'
Plug 'vim-scripts/bufkill.vim'

" General helpers and abbreviations such as
" bpry => require 'pry'; binding.pry;
" As well as extensions to projections
Plug 'hashrocket/vim-hashrocket'

" This is the plugin responsible for allowing us to do <leader>t to
" run our rspec tests from the test file.  I need to look into the internals.
" Either way, a definite keep.
Plug 'jgdavey/tslime.vim'
Plug 'jgdavey/vim-turbux'

" This is the block toggle for ruby block styles
" Worth keeping around
Plug 'jgdavey/vim-blockle'

Plug 'jgdavey/vim-weefactor'

" This is a plugin to allow user defined text objects, which is really friggin
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-user'

" Treats ruby blocks like text objects
" Depends on kana/vim-textobj-user
Plug 'nelstrom/vim-textobj-rubyblock'

" You should be using Rg
Plug 'mileszs/ack.vim'

" Auto-remove whitespace on write
Plug 'rondale-sc/vim-spacejam'

" Provides powerful utilities for Abbreviation, Substitution and Coercion
" (changing the type of casing for variables)
Plug 'tpope/vim-abolish'

" Adds support for bundler and gemfile highlighting
" as well as some basic functionality
Plug 'tpope/vim-bundler'

" This is where gc and gcc come from
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'

" Syntax highlighting and editing commands for cucumber files
" should go with things that I don't normally use
Plug 'tpope/vim-cucumber'

" Adds support for ending structures
" Example: blocks in ruby code like do/end
Plug 'tpope/vim-endwise'

" Provides vim sugar for common commands such as mv and write
" :Delete: Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
" :Unlink: Like :Delete, but keeps the now empty buffer.
" :Move: Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
" :Rename: Like :Move, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
" :Chmod: Change the permissions of the current file.
" :Mkdir: Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
" :Cfind: Run find and load the results into the quickfix list.
" :Clocate: Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
" :Lfind/:Llocate: Like above, but use the location list.
" :Wall: Write every open window. Handy for kicking off tools like guard.
" :SudoWrite: Write a privileged file with sudo.
" :SudoEdit: Edit a privileged file with sudo.
" File type detection for sudo -e is based on original file name.
" New files created with a shebang line are automatically made executable.
Plug 'tpope/vim-eunuch'

" This is where projections come from
" The entire idea of them is to make editing things within a well defined
" directory structure much easier, I use them sometimes, and generally they
" are quite useful when defined for a rails app, but they sometimes are not
" functional due to idiosyncrisies of the project that you are in. This is
" quite frustrating and keeps me from using them as opposed to FZF.
Plug 'tpope/vim-projectionist'

" Works with vim-surround
" Gives you completions for the different types of erb tags and does surround
" things.
Plug 'tpope/vim-ragtag'

" This is a big plugin for working with rails apps. It gives you `gf` to go to
" files that your cursor is on ( such as a partial ) and it also has some
" functionality that I was not familiar with like :Extract over a selection to
" create a partial from the selected content. This could be incredibly useful
" on the odd occasion.
Plug 'tpope/vim-rails'

" Let's you use projectionist type commands not in a rails app?
Plug 'tpope/vim-rake'

" This plugin allows others to create repeatable plugin actions, which is what
" `.` does.
Plug 'tpope/vim-repeat'

" Gives you some common readline shortcuts.
" https://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html
Plug 'tpope/vim-rsi'

" This doesn't seem strictly necessary.
" It's a collection of settings for vim that are considered reasonable by the
" author.
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'

" This does some automatic indent setting magic. However, I have noticed on a
" number of occasions that it's not what I want it to be. So perhaps this is a
" good place to start figuring that out.
Plug 'tpope/vim-sleuth'

" This lets you use <C-a>/<C-x> (inc/dec) on dates, which is pretty cool if
" you're futzing with them in a way that I am almost never futzing with
" them...
Plug 'tpope/vim-speeddating'

" This lets you surround things with other things and I love it.
" Example: ysiw + { will surround with {}
" To surround tightly use the closing form, otherwise will have a space
" inside.
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'

" Provides aliases for things like quickfix traversal
" [q
" [f
Plug 'tpope/vim-unimpaired'

" This helps make netrw much more powerful, and there are some things in here
" that I really ought to have known.
" In particular:
" Press '.' and you get :* path/to/file where * is the cursor
" Press '!' and you get the same thing as above but with a preceeding '!'
" Press Ctrl+^ and you will go back to wherever you were last
" Press ~ to go to $HOME
Plug 'tpope/vim-vinegar'

" Allows you to explore your buffers
" This is kind of obviated by the use of FZF from junegunn
" Personally I prefer FZF
Plug 'vim-scripts/bufexplorer.zip'

" staticly check code and highlight errors (async syntastic replacement)
